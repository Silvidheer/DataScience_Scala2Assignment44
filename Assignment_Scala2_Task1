A Fibonacci series (starting from 1) written in order without any spaces in between, thus producing a sequence of digits.
# Write a Scala application to find the Nth digit in the sequence.
○ Write the function using standard for loop

scala> def fib2( n : Int ) : Int = {
     |   var a = 0
     |   var b = 1
     |   var i = 0  
     |  
     |   while( i < n ) {
     |     val c = a + b
     |     a = b
     |     b = c
     |     i = i + 1
     |   } 
     |   return a
     | }
fib2: (n: Int)Int

scala> fib2(12)
res0: Int = 144

#Write a Scala application to find the Nth digit in the sequence.
○ Write the function using recursion

scala> def fib1( n : Int) : Int = n match {
     |    case 0 | 1 => n
     |    case _ => fib1( n-1 ) + fib1( n-2 )
     | }
fib1: (n: Int)Int

scala> fib1(12)
