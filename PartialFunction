3.Write a partial function to add three numbers in which one number is constant and two numbers can be passed as inputs and define another method which can take the partial function as input and squares the result.


scala> val addConstantTo: PartialFunction[(Int, Int), Int] = {
     |     case (a, b) => a + b + 12345
     | }
addConstantTo: PartialFunction[(Int, Int),Int] = <function1>

scala> addConstantTo(14,15)
res1: Int = 12374

scala> addConstantTo(12,34)
res2: Int = 12391

scala> val square: PartialFunction[Int, Int] = {
     |     case x if x >= 0 => x * x
     | }
square: PartialFunction[Int,Int] = <function1>

scala> square(2)
res3: Int = 4

scala> square(90
     | )
res4: Int = 8100

scala> square(addConstantTo(12,34))
res5: Int = 153536881
